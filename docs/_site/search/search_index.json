environmentwe recommended that you use the provided vscode devcontainers environment this will provide flux and go already installed so you can jump right into development you can follow the tutorial where you ll basicallyneed to install docker or compatible engine install the development containers extensionthen you can go to the command palette view gt command palette and select dev containers open workspace in container this will build a development environment from fluxrm flux sched you are free to change the base image and rebuild if you need to test on another operating system when your container is built when you open terminal gt new terminal surprise you rein the container important the development container assumes you are on a system with uid 1000 and gid 1000 if this isn t the case edit the devcontainer dockerfile to be your user and group id this will ensurechanges written inside the container are owned by your user it s recommended that you commit on your system not inside the container because if you need to sign your commits the container doesn thave access and won t be able to if you find that you accidentally muck up permissionsand need to fix you can run this from your terminal outside of vscode sudo chown r user git and then commitbuilding bindingsyou can build the examples using the makefile you can inspect it to see how simple it is we target the flux install in the container and youwould want to customize this based on your install of flux makethis will create a bin in the root directory and each executable demonstrates an example that you can match to a command file in cmd for any of the examplesbelow since the container starts running a flux instance you won t need to startone if you are developing and an instance isn t started you can do flux start test size 4", "title": "Getting Started"}]}
